SideScroll
==========

A sidescrolling shooter game, in python, that will be heavily customisable.

#Parts of the Game
-Menu - this is where the choice of; New Game, Continue, Options, Help, Credits and Exit will be listed. It will have a cool background...

-New game - This will start the game from begginning, possibly start the story off(if decide to add one), and will start with a ship(looking like, but not, the Arch linux symbol). 

The ship will be facing right and the background will be stars flying past to the left(makes it look cooler and gives impression of super fast speed).

The aim will be to survive each level to the end and defeat the boss of each section.

There will be powerups and extras along the way, as well as dangers.

-Continue - This will just start the game off where you last left it. Will start at last major action, such as start of new level.

-Options - This will allow toggling of certain elements such as sound and controls.

-Help - This will list everything you need to know about the game.

-Credits - List of all the awesome people who helped make this.

-Exit - Will close the program.
